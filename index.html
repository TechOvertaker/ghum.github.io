                        hamlet but smaller than a town (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and
                        smaller towns), with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though
                        villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain
                        urban neighborhoods. </h2>
