                    <h3 class="mainc small-text">A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a
                        hamlet but smaller than a town (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and
                        smaller towns), with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though
                        villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain
                        urban neighborhoods. </h3>

The road that leads to the village has big trees on either side and they are so full of life as if they are dancing with joy to welcome us to their village. I have never seen such a breathtaking scene. There is one temple in the village and daily one or the other festivals keep going on. There is a river near the temple. There are mango trees, Bengal currant( <em> karvanda</em>) trees, and a big Garcinia indica( <em> Kokum </em>) tree around the river. The smell of the flowers and mango buds attract everyoneâ€™s attention.</h2>
